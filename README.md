## Important Note

**Agent Studio** is an AI agent application designed to handle real-time interactions through phone calls, web-based voice user interfaces (VUI), and SIP capabilities. This open-source platform allows you to create advanced AI-driven communication systems. If you need an on-premise solution, customization, or a secure app setup without third-party APIs, please contact us at **info@nidum.ai**. We are available to assist with setup and provide tailored solutions to meet your requirements.

---

Welcome to the **Agent Studio** installation guide! This document will guide you through setting up the backend server, SIP server, and the user interface (UI). The **Agent Studio** leverages powerful technologies like **Groq**, a highly optimized LLM processing system, and **LlamaIndex** for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide real-time communication and data management.

The code repository for **Agent Studio** is available on GitHub: [NidumAI-Inc/agent-studio](https://github.com/NidumAI-Inc/agent-studio).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **MongoDB** (or access to a MongoDB instance)
- **Node.js and npm** (for the UI)
- **Git**
- **tmux** (for managing multiple terminal sessions)

---

## Step 1: Set Up Agent Studio Backend

### 1.1 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NidumAI-Inc/agent-studio.git
cd aistudio
```

### 1.2 Create a Virtual Environment

Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux and macOS
# For Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 1.3 Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 1.4 Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `app/env/` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p app/env
touch app/env/.env
```

Add the following content to `app/env/.env`:

```ini
# MongoDB settings
MONGO_USER=your_mongo_user
MONGO_PASSWORD=your_mongo_password
MONGO_HOST=your_mongo_host

# API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_livekit_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_livekit_api_secret
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key

# LiveKit URL
LIVEKIT_URL=ws://localhost:7880
```

**Note:** Replace placeholders (e.g., `your_mongo_user`, `your_openai_api_key`) with actual credentials.

### 1.5 Install the Agent Studio Package

```bash
pip install -e .
```

---

## Step 2: LiveKit and SIP Server On-Premise Installation

For setting up the LiveKit server and enabling SIP voice communication features, refer to the guides below. These guides will walk you through downloading, configuring, and running LiveKit and the SIP server for real-time communication:

- **[LiveKit On-Premise Installation Guide](https://github.com/NidumAI-Inc/agent-studio/blob/main/docs/livkit_server_setup.md)**
- **[SIP Server On-Premise Installation Guide](https://github.com/NidumAI-Inc/agent-studio/blob/main/docs/livkit_sip_server_setup.md)**

---

## Step 4: Set Up the User Interface (UI)

This section will guide you in setting up the Nidum Voice Agent and Nidum Bot projects. These two UI components are interlinked and must be configured correctly.

### 4.1 Clone the Repositories

Clone both repositories to your local machine:

```bash
# Clone Nidum Voice Agent repository
git clone https://github.com/NidumAI-Inc/agent-studio-ui.git
cd agent-studio-ui  # Nidum Voice Agent directory

# Clone Nidum VUI (Nidum Bot) repository
git clone https://github.com/NidumAI-Inc/agent-studio-vui-widget.git
cd agent-studio-vui-widget  # Nidum Bot directory
```

### 4.2 Install Dependencies

Install the dependencies for both projects separately.

**Nidum Voice Agent:**

```bash
cd aistudio_ui
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

**Nidum Bot:**

```bash
cd aistudio_vui_widget
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 4.3 Environment Configuration

Both projects require environment variables for configuration. Set up the environment variables for each project before running them.

#### Nidum Voice Agent Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `aistudio_ui` directory and add the following variables:

```ini
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret

LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_livekit_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_livekit_api_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL=ws://localhost:7880

GMAIL_ID=your_gmail_id
GMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_password

NEXT_PUBLIC_ML_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
ALLOWED_BOT_ORIGINS=[]
NEXT_PUBLIC_BOT_LIVE_URL=http://localhost:5000  # Adjust the port if necessary
```

**Note:** Refer to the `.env.example` file in the repository for details on each variable.

#### Nidum Bot Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `aistudio_vui_widget` directory and add the following variables:

```ini
VITE_API_LIVEKIT_URL=ws://localhost:7880
VITE_API_NEXT_backend=http://localhost:3000  # Nidum Voice Agent backend URL
VITE_API_ML_Backend=http://localhost:8000  # Agent Studio backend URL
```

**Note:** Check the `.env.example` file in the repository for more details.

### 4.4 Running the Development Servers

#### 4.4.1 Start the Nidum Voice Agent Development Server

Navigate to the `aistudio_ui` directory and run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the Nidum Voice Agent.

#### 4.4.2 Start the Nidum Bot Development Server

Navigate to the `aistudio_vui_widget` directory and run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build

# Install serve globally if not already installed
npm install -g serve
# or
yarn global add serve
# or
pnpm add -g serve

# Serve the build
serve -s dist
```

Now, Nidum Bot will be accessible and can be integrated with the Nidum Voice Agent.

### 4.5 Project Integration

Both projects are interdependent and must be configured correctly to interact:

- **Nidum Voice Agent** relies on **Nidum Bot** for bot communication capabilities. Ensure that `NEXT_PUBLIC_BOT_LIVE_URL` in Nidum Voice Agent's `.env` file points to the correct URL of the Nidum Bot (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).
- **Nidum Bot** needs to communicate with the Nidum Voice Agent backend. Ensure that the `VITE_API_NEXT_backend` environment variable is correctly set to point to the Nidum Voice Agentâ€™s backend URL (`http://localhost:3000`).

---

## Step 5: Run Agent Studio and UI

### 5.1 Start Agent Studio Backend

In one terminal window, activate your virtual environment and run:

```bash
aistudio start api


```

### 5.2 Start the Agent

In another terminal window, activate your virtual environment and run:

```bash
aistudio start agent
```

### 5.3 Start the Vision Agent

The `vision-agent` feature provides additional capabilities for visual data processing, though it currently has limited functionality. Start it in a new terminal window:

```bash
aistudio start vision-agent
```

**Note:** The `vision-agent` is in its initial stages and currently offers limited functionality. Further updates will expand its capabilities.

### 5.4 Access the Application

- **Agent Studio Backend API Docs:** [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- **Nidum Voice Agent UI:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Nidum Bot UI:** Accessible through the Nidum Voice Agent interface.

## Step 6: Start Services in `tmux` Sessions

For continuous logging and management, weâ€™ll start the following scripts in separate `tmux` sessions:

1. **Chat Log Creation Service**
2. **SIP Log Creation Service**
3. **Agent Studio App**

To do this, follow the instructions below.

### 6.1 Open a `tmux` Session for Chat Log Creation

Start `chat_log_creation.py` in a new `tmux` session:

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s chat_log "python /app/log_service/chat_log_creation.py"
```

This will create a detached `tmux` session named `chat_log` running `chat_log_creation.py`. You can attach to this session using:

```bash
tmux attach -t chat_log
```

### 6.2 Open a `tmux` Session for SIP Log Creation

Start `sip_log_creation.py` in a new `tmux` session:

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s sip_log "python /Users/kesavan/aistudio/app/log_service/sip_log_creation.py"
```

This will create a detached `tmux` session named `sip_log` running `sip_log_creation.py`. You can attach to this session using:

```bash
tmux attach -t sip_log
```

### 6.3 Open a `tmux` Session for Agent Studio

To start the main `aistudio` app in a `tmux` session, replace the incorrect command with:

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s aistudio "aistudio start api"
```

This will create a detached `tmux` session named `aistudio`. You can attach to this session using:

```bash
tmux attach -t aistudio
```

To view or manage any of these sessions, list them using:

```bash
tmux list-sessions
```
